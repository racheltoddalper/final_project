# Dashboard code will go here. We haven't covered this yet.

# ideas:
# some sort of plot of income and number of violations or seasonal number of violations but you can toggle it by type of violation
# seasonal trends map where you toggle the months to see which violation types are the most common
# or select a violation type and then toggle for seasonal trends
